	    * Destroy() method is called with singleton scope bean but not with prototype because
	    * Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean: 
	    * the container instantiates, configures, decorates and otherwise assembles a prototype object, 
	    * hands it to the client and then has no further knowledge of that prototype instance. 
	    * For releasing resources try to implement a custom bean post processor.
	    *
	    * destroymethod specifies a method that is called just before a bean is removed from the 
	    * container
	    * 
	    * The org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean interface specifies
	    *  a single method âˆ’
	    *  void destroy() throws Exception;
